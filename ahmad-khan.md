# My name is Khan
I am not a terrorist. By no means have I ever sought to violently harm any individual for any political purpose. Nor have I ever been a member or even so much as condoned any malitia or militant group(s). 

However, my mere existence and freedom is a sufficient blow to unscrupulous corporations and imperialist regimes like the British Crown who are promoters of slavery and colonialism. 

## Background
To subdue my freedom and to silence me, on May 15th 2020 I was apprehended by Waterloo Regional Police (WRPS). I was arrested under false and slanderous charges written up on a "Form 2" by members of the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA). The Form 2 write up connoted that, "I am a violent person with psychosis who identifies with merceneries and has had a history of dealing with militants."

Upon being appreheded and committed to Grand River Hospital (GRH) psychiatry ward against my will, I was forcibly adminstered psychotropic drugs that had a contradiction to my existing medical history. The drugs forced into me harmed my neuroendocrine and reproductive systems. Worst of all, the contradiction could have killed me via a thrombosis resulting in a stroke or cardiac arrest. 

Such biggoted and underhanded tactics used by members of CMHA in coordination with WRPS and GRH are a gross violation of authority provided to them through the Mental Health Act of the Ontario Government. In this regard I hold the following entities responsible for the damages, harm and injustice inflicted upon me: 

  - the particular individuals invovled, 
  - their affiliated institutions, 
  - the colleges or formal bodies providing them accreditation and
  - the government of Ontario under whose statutory laws, policies, acts and purview a prejudiced crime of this nature was committed.
  
## Plea for justice
Upon consulting with lawyers I was informed that to even bring my case forward to a court I would need upwards of $50,000 (fifty thousand dollars). This is an exorbitant amount that I cannot affod and it is evident that the justice system is inaccessible to a person like me who has suffered damages at the hands of various sister bodies of the government's justice department. The harm done to me in the past months has exacerbated my mental health disability due to attention defficit disorder (ADD). For this reason I have been unable to earn a living and have been reduced to poverty and distress during an ongoing pandemic. 

Prior to this deplorable neurochemical assault against me through clinicians at CMHA and GRH, the federal agency called Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) was mucking around with my application for permanent residence in Canada. Due to IRCC's professional malfeasence and poor systems management my application continued to get delayed and put me through severe healthcare and financial trauma.
